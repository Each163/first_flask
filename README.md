# first_flask
## Forum website
This flask project is about a *online* _forum website_. It is still **under development**, and it may take ***several weeks*** (~~or maybe several months~~)
This project is built by following this [tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17r4y1y7jJ/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click)
My plan is:
- learn flask
- [x] Create a simple interactive website:+1:
- [ ] Use Bootstrap to create a website
- [ ] Implement it on a server
\*The way to add emoji in a markdown file can be found in this [cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)

The tutorial for the basic syntax[^1] for .md is [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
<!-- You may notice that this .md file is used for trying the syntax from the tutorial, which means actually I don't have a plan for this project now :joy: -->
[^1]:The syntax I used in this README markdown file
